          Feeding your pet the right food is key to their health and longevity. At Pet Paradise, we offer a variety of pet foods and custom diets to suit every pet’s needs.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Understand Your Pet’s Needs</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Different pets require different nutrients based on their age, breed, and activity level. For example, puppies need more protein, while senior cats may benefit from joint-supporting formulas.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Read Labels Carefully</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          Look for high-quality ingredients and avoid fillers like corn or soy. Our staff can guide you to the best options in-store.
        </p>
